### Hello, I'm [Wojciech!](https://kocjan.net) ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a full stack web developer. I enjoy working on web-related projects, especially in a startup environment.

My current tech stack usually combines Laravel (PHP) on the backend and React (JS) on the frontend. I like to use GatsbyJS, Inertia.js and headless CMS.
