### Hello, I'm [Wojciech!](https://kocjan.net) ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an experienced Frontend-oriented Product Engineer.

I learned HTML and launched my first website back in 2001 when I was in high school. Since then I've experienced the web industry in many different roles and angles.

I enjoy the entire scope of the product development process. I care not only about the code, but always try to understand the product, and the problem it solves.

I'm a fan of agile/lean methodologies. I like working remotely and know how to do it effectively. Iâ€™m constantly learning new stuff, usually by working on side projects.

ðŸ‘· I'm currently working on [TeamBuddy](https://teambuddy.app) - the app which helps build and maintain a great team culture.
